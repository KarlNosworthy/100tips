# 100tips

100 tips for developers. Hopefully most will be obvious. Suggestions welcome.

## Tabbed apps (Chrome/Firefox/iTerm etc)
1. `cmd-n` to select a particular tab, where `n` is 1-8 (`cmd-9` to select last)
1. `cmd-+`, `cmd--` to zoom in and out (`cmd-0` to restore the zoom level to 100%)
    
    ## *nix
1. Resume remote sessions using `screen`
1. Time long command with `time`
1. Symlink your dotfiles (`.vimrc` etc.) to Dropbox / Google drive for consitent settings across devices (company?)

    ## IntelliJ IDEA
1. `ctrl-space` to suggest alternatives using code-complete.
1. Select suggestion with `enter` to insert, or `tab` to overwrite
 
    ## OSX
1. On OSX, press `alt-]` or `alt-shift-]` to get typographic apostrophes `‘` and `’`
1. Use `cmd-tab` to toggle between open apps
1. Use ``cmd-` `` to toggle between multiple windows of current app

    ## General
1. In browser address bar, press `ctrl-enter` to surround word with `http://` and `.com`
1. Many websites show a keyboard shortcut cheatsheet when you press `?` (eg. gmail, twitter, github)


Ok, I haven't thought of 100 yet, please help!
